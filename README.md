# Camera VS Lidar Project
# University of Patras - Spring Semester 2024-2025  

This project is part of the **3D Computational Geometry and Computer Vision** course and aims to compare **Camera-based** and **LiDAR-based** approaches for **road segmentation**. The implementation utilizes techniques such as disparity maps, flood fill, edge detection, morphological operations, and line detection to evaluate the effectiveness of each modality in detecting road regions.

# Dataset

In order to run the project, you must download the dataset manually from:  

https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php

After downloading:  
Place the **`road photos`** folder in the **root directory** of the project.

# Installation

Install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
